# Superfun Adventure

## Overview
**Superfun Adventure** is a 2D side-scrolling jump-and-run shooter with meta-horror elements.  
What starts as a nostalgic retro arcade experience slowly breaks down as the game becomes aware of itself. With each level, visuals, systems, and rules degrade until the game itself turns against the player.
